I’m pleased to be able to write that the Corilla public beta has now gone live. You can get started right now:

- [Create your documentation with Corilla](http://www.corilla.com/).

## Introducing Corilla

Corilla is a collaborative publishing tool for technical writers. It solves the problem of authoring, managing and maintaining documentation in the cloud and at scale. We do this by enabling an end-to-end writing and publishing workflow that incorporates a blazing-fast Markdown editor, inbuilt version control, and a method of creating dynamic groups of reusable content for on-demand publishing that you’re going to love.

> Corilla does for the rest of the office what Github has done for developers.

All accounts are free for our initial beta, and open source projects will be free for life. So get started today and let us know what you think. You might also like to take a moment to watch the overview video of Corilla’s easy workflow. Bonus points if you can pick the accent.

G’day mate. This is Corilla calling.

## Inside the beta

Launching a beta is an incredible experience. It’s a time to draw a line in the sand and say “this is where we are starting, this is where we would like to go from here, and we’re ready to listen and do that together”. It’s also an opportunity to really reflect on and reinforce our principles and relationship to our community. And one that has amazingly followed us since I left Red Hat to focus on Corilla full time.

Corilla treats all content as modular Topics.

We will be expanding on this in the first draft of The Corilla Manifesto. A document that we will be sharing in the coming weeks that sums up our vision. And also one that I hope will guide us as a growing team with a great founding culture.

We will also be looking to implement a few other expressions of the transparency within our culture. Such as opening up our Slack instance, catching up on some important work open sourcing parts of Corilla’s technical journey, and sharing our roadmap.
And of course we are always available for discussion, bugs or feature requests via email or on our Twitter account at @corilla.

Corilla’s Collections are a dynamic group for your Topic content.

## And there’s more to come

Even as I type this we are hard at work improving and iterating the technical writing experience. We’ve got a lot of work to do on extending the basic functionality even as we move toward the really exciting stuff.

You will notice this fortnight will be all about improving the onboarding experience — so please bear with us. But we’re here together, and welcome your input (and your patience) and your excitement too.

Inside a Collection you can simply drag and drop the Topics you want to publish in our dynamic Table Of Contents.
Here’s a preview of what’s to come:
- In-line contextual formatting
- Views for version control diffs and merges
- Bulk importing/exporting
- Multiple format outputs (ePub, PDF, other APIs, etc)
- Media and file management
- Slack integrations (among others)
- Improved onboarding and documentation
- Editorial and QE modes
- Published content analytics
- Improved multi-author mode
- Customisable CSS on published collections
- [You tell us](http://corilla.com/contact)!

So please join us in taking a moment to celebrate the release of the first beta. I welcome you to [start authoring and managing your documentation with Corilla today](https://app.corilla.com/register).
