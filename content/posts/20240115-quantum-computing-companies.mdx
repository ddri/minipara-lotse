## Companies

### Alice&Bob

Alice&Bob is a French startup developing fault-tolerant quantum computers with an interesting approach to error correction. The company's "cat qubits" are designed to be intrinsically error-resistant. By focusing on hardware-level error correction, Alice&Bob aims to create quantum computers that can perform long, complex calculations without being overwhelmed by errors. This approach could significantly accelerate the timeline for practical, large-scale quantum computers, making them useful for real-world applications sooner than other architectures.    The company's work is particularly important because error correction is widely considered the primary bottleneck in scaling up quantum computers to tackle problems beyond the reach of classical supercomputers.

### Alpine Quantum Technologies
Focuses on trapped-ion quantum computing for industrial applications.
Alpine Quantum Technologies (AQT) is an Austrian company spun out from the University of Innsbruck, a longtime leader in quantum research. AQT specializes in trapped-ion quantum computing for industrial applications. Their approach is notable for its high coherence times and all-to-all connectivity between qubits, which can be advantageous for certain algorithms. AQT is focused on creating compact, commercially viable quantum computers that can be used in real-world industrial settings. Their systems are designed to operate at room temperature, unlike many other quantum technologies that require extreme cooling.

### Atom Computing
Atom Computing uses optically trapped neutral atoms as qubits, allowing it to operate at room temperature. Their technology uses lasers to trap and manipulate individual atoms, allowing for precise control and measurement. One of the key advantages of Atom Computing's approach is the potential for creating large arrays of qubits with long coherence times. Their first-generation machine, Phoenix, already claims 100 qubits, and the company has ambitious plans for rapid scaling.

### AWS Braket
Amazon Web Services (AWS) Braket is not a quantum hardware manufacturer, but rather a quantum computing service that provides access to different types of quantum hardware through the cloud. AWS Braket provides a unified development environment for building quantum algorithms and testing them on a range of quantum hardware from providers like D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti. This multi-hardware approach is valuable because different quantum computing technologies have different strengths and are at different stages of development. By providing access to various systems, AWS Braket enables users to compare and choose the best hardware for their specific problems. The service also includes classical quantum simulators, allowing users to test and debug quantum algorithms before running them on actual quantum hardware.

### Bleximo
Develops superconducting quantum processors for specific industry applications. They are a California-based startup developing application-specific quantum processors. They use superconducting qubit technology, similar to that used by Google and IBM, but tailor their processors for specific industry applications such as quantum chemistry simulations for drug discovery or optimization problems in finance. This focused approach allows Bleximo to optimize their hardware for particular types of quantum algorithms, potentially achieving practical quantum advantage in specific domains sooner than general-purpose machines. Bleximo's quantum processors operate at extremely low temperatures, requiring specialized cooling systems.
