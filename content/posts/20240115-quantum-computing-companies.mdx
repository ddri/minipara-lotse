## Companies

### Alice&Bob

Alice&Bob is a French startup developing fault-tolerant quantum computers with an interesting approach to error correction. The company's "cat qubits" are designed to be intrinsically error-resistant. By focusing on hardware-level error correction, Alice&Bob aims to create quantum computers that can perform long, complex calculations without being overwhelmed by errors. This approach could significantly accelerate the timeline for practical, large-scale quantum computers, making them useful for real-world applications sooner than other architectures. The company's work is particularly important because error correction is widely considered the primary bottleneck in scaling up quantum computers to tackle problems beyond the reach of classical supercomputers.
