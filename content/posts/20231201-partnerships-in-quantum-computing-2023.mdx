## Purpose

This is a short collection of examples of partnerships in the quantum computing industry. The reasons for such partnerships can vary, ranging from commercial milestones between vendors and potential commercial customers, through to relationships of significance to sovereign capability or the efforts of specific research institutions. The impact of such things beyond a press release is not always clear, and while many such relationships will lead to revenue-generating action, stimulate future fundraising rounds, or begin a long process for potential future M&A, many are equally likely to just fade out of memory. Whatever the outcomes, they do make for interesting signals when evaluating the tempo and nature of the quantum industry over any give timescale. In this case the year 2023.
