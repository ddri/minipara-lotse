There are many architectures being explored in the current era of quantum computing. The following is a collection of such approaches gathered as personal notes per part of my role on the product team at Quantum Brilliance. This collection was written in February of 2023 so take care if referencing in the future. 

## Superconducting qubits
Superconducting qubits are among the most advanced and widely used quantum computing architectures. They are built using superconducting circuits and operate at extremely low temperatures, near absolute zero. These qubits leverage the quantum properties of Josephson junctions, which allow for the creation of artificial atoms with quantized energy levels. Superconducting qubits are favored by many major players in the field, including IBM, Google, and Rigetti, due to their scalability and relatively long coherence times. They offer fast gate operations and the potential for high-density qubit arrays, making them promising for large-scale quantum computers.

## Trapped-ion qubits
Trapped-ion quantum computers use individual ions (charged atoms) as qubits, held in place by electromagnetic fields. This architecture is known for its exceptionally long coherence times and high-fidelity operations. Trapped-ion systems can operate at or near room temperature, which is an advantage over some other architectures. Companies like IonQ and Honeywell (now part of Quantinuum) are at the forefront of trapped-ion quantum computing. While scaling up the number of qubits is challenging, recent advancements in chip-based ion traps are addressing this issue.
