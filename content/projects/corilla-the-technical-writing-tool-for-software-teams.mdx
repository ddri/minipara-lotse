## About Corilla

Corilla was a collaborative technical writing tool for software teams. It solved the problem of creating, managing and maintaining a suite of software documentation across teams with a focus on content re-use, component-based modularity, and topic-based authoring.

Corilla spun out of Red Hat in Australia in 2013, went through the NUMA startup accelerator in Paris, France, and then scaled to over 85 countries worldwide. The team made the decision to wind down and exit in the lead-up to the pandemic.
