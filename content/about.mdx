## Hello world

My name is David Ryan, an Australia technical product manager and former SaaS founder. I work in the Quantum Computing industry, focusing on open source and quantum strategy at OSRG, and formerly was the Head of Product at Quantum Brilliance, as well as a key part of Red Hat's open source developer relations and technical writing team.

This site is, as the name might suggest, a place where I publish resources, posts, or works in progress across the topics of quantum computing, Deep Tech, product management, technical writing, and business strategy. Drop me a line on LinkedIn if you want to get in touch.
